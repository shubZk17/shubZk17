### About Me

I am a Chemical Engineering undergraduate with a strong academic and practical focus on Machine Learning, Data Science, and scalable Software Systems. My work centers around building end-to-end ML pipelines that move from exploratory data analysis to model development, explainability, and deployment.

I am particularly interested in:
- Interpretable Machine Learning and model explainability  
- Robust ML system design for real-world applications  
- Mathematical reasoning in modern AI systems  
- Applied research in Natural Language Processing
